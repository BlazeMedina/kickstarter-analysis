## Overview of Project

  

### This project was designed to visualize the correlation of Kickstarter launch dates to success and also of the goals set to success.

  

## Analysis and Challenges

  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  I can conclude that percentage of successful kickstarters launched in May was greater and that kickstarters launched in December had about an equal chance of succeeding and failing.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  Kickstarters with a goal of below $5,000 or between $35,000 and $45,000 had a greater chance of succeeding.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

  One of the limitations of the dataset is that the first table/graph was not filtered for only plays.

## Results

  **According to this analysis, there is a greater probability of a successful Kickstarter campaign if it is launched in May and the goal is set to either below $5,000 or is set to $35,000 - $45,000.**

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

I can conclude that percentage of successful kickstarters launched in May was greater and that kickstarters launched in December had about an equal chance of succeeding and failing.

  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Kickstarters with a goal of below $5,000 or between $35,000 and $45,000 had a greater chance of succeeding.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One of the limitations of the dataset is that the first table/graph was not filtered for only plays.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Create graph that is filtered for the US only.

Create a graph or table that visualizes the goals set at launch dates per month so that one can tell what goals were set on the more successful May launch dates.
